# Development process

We use Gulp tasks to lint, test and build this project. Please check
[gulp-shared-tasks](https://github.com/ehmicky/gulp-shared-tasks) to learn how
to use them. You don't need to know Gulp to use them.

# Requirements

We enforce 100% test coverage, i.e. each line of code must be tested.

Documentation must be added for any new feature in all of these:

- the `README.md`
- the `docs` folder (if any)
- the `examples` folder (if any)

After submitting the pull request, please make sure the Continuous Integration
checks are passing.
